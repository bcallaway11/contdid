Description: Provides methods for difference-in-differences with a continuous treatment and staggered treatment adoption. Includes estimation of treatment effects and causal responses as a function of the dose, event studies indexed by length of exposure to the treatment, and aggregation into overall average effects. Uniform inference procedures are included, along with both parametric and nonparametric models for treatment effects. The methods are based on Callaway, Goodman-Bacon, and Sant'Anna (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2107.02637>.
