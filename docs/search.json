Next, important parameters target_parameter, aggregation, treatment_type: target_parameter can either “level” “slope”. “level”, function calculate ATT parameters. set “slope”, function calculate ACRT parameters—causal response parameters derivatives ATT parameters. paper Callaway, Goodman-Bacon, Sant’Anna (2024) points complications interpreting derivative type parameters commonly invoked version parallel trends assumption. aggregation can either “eventstudy” “dose”. “eventstudy”, depending value target_parameter argument, function provide either average ATT across different event times average ACRT across different event times. “dose”, function average across time periods report average affects across different values continuous treatment. “dose” aggregation, results calculated ATT ACRT can displayed providing different arguments plotting functions (see example ). treatment_type can either “continuous” “discrete”.
